/*	
	Removes the 30 fps frame limiter for the GOG version.
	The GOG version replaces a call to check the IDirect3DDevice9::TestCooperativeLevel of the renderer, after IDirect3DDevice9::Present is called 
	to a jump to the frame limiter routine.
	This patch restores the original call. It will have no effect on the Steam version as the code it's replacing is identical.
