# Saints Row 2 Monkey Patch

## Introduction

This code patches at runtime the game Saint Row 2 for the PC. It works by creating a fake DFEngine.dll file which is loaded by the game at runtime.

Hopefully this will be expanded by the Saints Row 2 community.

## Build instructions

This code is built using Visual Studio 2005. I use this version as it is, most probably the version the original game was written in.

A newer version may work with a newer version of visual studio, however it may add unpredictable compatibility problems.

## How to use?

Just replace the DFEngine.dll is the game's main directory with the one generated by this code, making a back-up of the original if needed.

You can just run the game as usual. You may be able to pass some command line parameters to some patches.

To remove just restore the original DFEngine.dll file.

## What patches are available?

At this moment in time, these patches are available. 

* Removes the ads from the game, and telemetry (if used by the game).
* Removes the fps limiter of the GOG version. You can disable this patch using the command line parameter **keepfpslimit**.
* Integrates OpenSpy as a replacement for GameSpy.
* (Testing) Fixes the speed up bug automatically without the need to use powertools.

## License

This code is written under the MIT license. I chose this as it's the least restrictive license.
